# hello-world
just another repository!

I'm a self-taught programmer that has started out with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  I had also been able to work with a few other technologies but at the moment I am working on a progject that uses NodeJS, Express, Mongo/Mongoose.

Since I haven't really used GitHub like I should be, I have created this file as part of Git's tutorial.

This commit is just adding to the README file.
